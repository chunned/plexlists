Plexlists is an application that facilitates creating more advanced playlists and collections than are possible by default in Plex.

The initial focus of the project is on music libraries.

# Plans
- Have not yet thought about the real structure of the application and its feature set. The main idea is having a way to create and manage playlists, avoiding the shortcomings of building playlists in Plex directly. 
- Also just a general alternative to making playlists in Plex. I hate the Plex UI for smart playlists
  - Additionally, some fields available for smart playlists don't always work. For instance, I am unable to create a collection of The Simpsons episodes airing before a certain year, despite all episodes having the necessary metadata

Examples:
- List of completed albums (every track having at least 1 listen)
- Artist playlists
  - Plex can easily make a smart playlist based on track artist, but what about tracks the artist is only featured on?
